 ✅ Food Feature Preparation Checklist

We'll build the Food module later, but for now:

---

 📦 What We’ll Need When You’re Ready:

1. Food Mongoose Model

   * `title`, `description`, `price`
   * `slug` (unique, auto-generated)
   * `images`, `coverImage`, `categoryId`, `subcategoryIds`
   * `ownerId`, `isPublished`, `location`, `contact`, etc.
   * `availability` (optional: for timing or stock)
   * `reviews`, `averageRating`, `totalReviews`
   * GeoJSON: `location` + `contact.address`

2. APIs to Build

   * `POST /api/foods` → Create food listing
   * `GET /api/foods/my` → Get foods listed by vendor
   * `PUT /api/foods/:id` → Update food
   * `DELETE /api/foods/:id` → Delete food
   * (Optional) `GET /api/foods/nearby` → For customers, based on location

3. Utilities to Reuse

   * `generateUniqueSlug()` logic (same as Service)
   * `geocodeAddress()` from address → \[lng, lat]
