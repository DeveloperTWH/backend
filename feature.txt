Thank you for the clarification. âœ… Yes, you can create Stripe Products and Prices programmatically from your application (admin portal) using Stripe's API.
You donâ€™t have to go to the Stripe Dashboard every time.



 Example Flow for Admin Portal

 1. Admin Creates a New Plan in the Admin Portal

 Admin fills:

   Product name â†’ e.g., "Pro Plus Plan"
   Price â†’ e.g., â‚¹499
   Billing cycle â†’ e.g., monthly

 2. Your Backend Creates Product & Price in Stripe

js
// 1. Create a Product
const product = await stripe.products.create({
  name: 'Pro Plus Plan',
  description: 'Access to Pro Plus features',
});

// 2. Create a Price for the Product
const price = await stripe.prices.create({
  product: product.id,
  unit_amount: 49900, // price in paisa (â‚¹499.00)
  currency: 'inr',
  recurring: { interval: 'month' },
});

// Save product.id and price.id in your DB




 Now your App Can Use:

js
items: [{ price: price.id }]


You donâ€™t need to hardcode/copy-paste anything.
The new price.id will be fetched dynamically from your DB when creating a subscription.



 ðŸ”‘ Summary:

| Task                                 | Where?                     |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Create new plan/product              | âœ” In your app admin portal |
| Create new price                     | âœ” In your app admin portal |
| Use priceId in subscription creation | âœ” From your DB             |


 âœ… Conclusion:

Yes, you can create Products & Prices dynamically from your application, and manage all subscription plans without using the Stripe Dashboard.
The Dashboard becomes optional.

Let me know if you want the complete admin-side API for this.
