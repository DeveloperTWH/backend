    Implemented Search button functionality to fetch services on click.
    Showed/hid the `<CategoryGrid />` component based on active filter values.
    Embedded Google Maps iframe for the selected service's address in the map sidebar.

    categorySlug → categoryId conversion
    search, city, minorityType filters
    sorting by price, rating, and reviews.
