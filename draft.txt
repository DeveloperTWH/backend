02-09-2025

   1. Added seedBusinessId and vendorFirst to res.locals.similar: seedBusinessId carries the seed product’s vendor so the controller can detect same-vendor items, and vendorFirst (default true, override with ?vendorFirst=0) tells the controller to show a top block of same-vendor products (seed excluded, sorted by score) before interleaving the rest by plan weight (cap applies only to “others”).

03-09-2025

   4. Created the mailer utility function which uses Nodemailer to send Paid Order (Vendor) email with PDF invoice when Stripe `payment_intent.succeeded` marks the order as paid to the vendor/business (vendorId.email, businessId.email, businessId.owner.email; deduped).
   5. Attempted approval without completed onboarding → 400 response, no state change, no email.
   6. Blocked → approved (re-approval) → same Approved email with CTA /partners/{slug}.
   7. PDF invoice (PDFKit) → items (name/SKU/size/color/qty), unit & line totals, grand total from `totalAmount` (minor→major), clean layout.
   8. Branding & deliverability → CID logo, clear preheaders, `List-Unsubscribe` header, concise action-oriented copy.
   9. Integrated Service Category Api In the Service page to Display the Service Managed by Admin Dashboard

   2. Reject Order Flow – Modified rejectOrder controller to trigger rejection email after saving the order and handle Stripe refund with correct vendor account.
   3. Stripe Fix – Corrected Stripe Connect account reference to ensure refunds are processed from the vendor’s connected account.
   4. Accept Order Flow – Modified acceptOrder controller to send acceptance email after stock adjustment and saving the order.
   5. Removed dummy address (John Doe) → no hard-coded default in production.
   6. Decided current flow → users must enter delivery details fresh each time (no saved addresses yet).
   7. Fixed email code – added `axios`, made the Nodemailer transporter a singleton, and embedded the logo as a CID buffer so it always shows in inboxes.
   8. HTML → PDF invoices – swapped out PDFKit for Puppeteer; added `utils/pdfFromHtml.js` and a clean, branded template in `utils/invoiceHtml.js`.
   9. Invoice service – `services/invoiceService.js` renders a PDF from a populated order so any part of the app can reuse it.
   10. Invoice controller – `controllers/invoiceController.js` streams the PDF, handles inline vs download, and basic id validation.
   11. Download route – `GET /api/orders/:id/invoice.pdf?download=1` so customers/vendors can view or download their invoice directly.
   12. Totals fix – smart `toMajor(...)` auto-detects if `totalAmount` is minor or major (using subtotal as a hint) and `showAdj` is a boolean, keeping Subtotal/Adjustments/Grand Total accurate.

   -----------------listed

   mosaic-biz-hub : 

   1. Address Line 2 search: Hooked Google Places Autocomplete to addr2Ref and built a formatter (route/neighborhood/sublocality) so street/locality auto-fills; Address Line 1 stays manual (house/apt).
   2. Use my location: Added reverse-geocode via Google Geocoder on GPS coords to fill ZIP, city, state, country and compose Address Line 2 automatically.
   3. US-only enforcement: Scoped Autocomplete to country: ["US"] and, after selection/geocode, checked countryShort !== "US" → show alert, clear address fields, keep country fixed to “United States.”
   4. ZIP-first flow: Postal code comes first; when a valid US ZIP is typed we geocode it to auto-fill city/state. Non-US/invalid ZIPs are caught and cleared (with an alert).


   ---------------listed



   5. Slug → ID in backend: Controller now accepts categorySlug/subcategorySlug, looks up Mongo _id from your ProductCategory/ProductSubcategory models, then calls the existing service unchanged.
   6. Dynamic route on frontend: Read [productid] from the URL with useParams() and pass it as categorySlug so /furniture fetches that category directly.
   7. Fixed API call: Corrected path to /api/products/ranked and normalized NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL (no double slashes); added query params via URLSearchParams.
   8. Grid wired to API: Replaced local JSON filter with a fetch to your RankedResponse; lightly filter client-side by price/brand before rendering.
   9. Accurate discount badge: Recomputed % off as ((price - sale)/price)100 (no integer rounding) and formatted to 1 decimal only when needed (e.g., -0.5%).
   10. Card UX polish: Kept drag-safe Swiper (no accidental clicks), clamped title/description lines, and showed price/rating consistently; optional sale badge appears when onSale is true.

   crown-standard : (Listed today as mentioned)

   1. Conducted a comprehensive review of Stripe payment flows for CrownStandard, focusing on marketplace/service scenarios and their implications for compliance, settlement timing, refunds, and financial reporting.

   2. Performed a comparative evaluation of Authorization (hold) versus Capture (settled) models, detailing impacts on fund availability, authorization expiry risk, operational processes, and customer experience.

   3. Adopted the payment strategy “Capture at checkout, transfer post-OTP”, selected for its timing flexibility, elimination of authorization-expiry exposure, and streamlined reconciliation.

   4. Defined the end-to-end OTP-gated fund release process: customer payment, service fulfillment, OTP verification, remittance of 75% to the provider, and retention of 25% as the platform fee.

   5. Standardized the use of `transfer_group` to associate the originating PaymentIntent/charge with all downstream transfers and potential reversals, ensuring traceability and auditability across the transaction lifecycle.

   6. Produced an upper-level architecture for the payment flow, identifying principal actors (Customer, Platform, Provider), core services (Checkout, Orders, OTP, Payments, Webhooks), relevant data stores, and the event sequence (Charge → Platform Balance → OTP Validation → Provider Transfer → Payout).

05-09-2025

   1. Added Finance link to Sidebar (partner dashboard) pointing to /partners/[businessId]/finance.
   2. Created Finance page (finance/page.tsx) with embedded Stripe Connect components: Payments + Payouts.

   9. Updated Stripe webhook (checkout.session.completed) to save session.customer → business.stripeCustomerId and backfill when subscription already linked.
   10. Built POST /stripe/backfill-customers to populate missing stripeCustomerId (supports batching / all).
   11. Updated TypeScript Business interface to include optional stripeCustomerId.
   12. Created /api endpoints for Subscription & Billing (external backend):

      GET  /api/subscriptions/current?businessId=...
      POST /api/subscriptions/:id/cancel (body: businessId, atPeriodEnd)
      POST /api/subscriptions/:id/resume (body: businessId)
      POST /api/billing-portal/session (body: businessId, resolves customer server-side)
   13. Refactored My Account page to use those endpoints via apiBase, including withCredentials.
   14. Hooked up Open Billing Portal on My Account to call ${apiBase}/api/billing-portal/session with businessId.
   15. Secured API routes with authenticate and isBusinessOwner middlewares (expects businessId in query/body).
   16. Finalized approach: one Stripe customer per business (supports vendors with multiple businesses cleanly).
