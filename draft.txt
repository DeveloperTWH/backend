 Frontend (Next.js / TypeScript):

    Integrated Get Service by Slug API (`/api/public/services/:slug`) on the Service Detail page.
    Displayed service details and reviews dynamically instead of using static data.
    Corrected TypeScript types for `Service` and `Review`, and created an API response interface.
    Handled Loading and Not Found states using Loader2 and AlertTriangle icons.
    Converted phone, email, and website fields into clickable `tel:`, `mailto:`, and external links.
    Connected to the Service List API (`/api/services/list`) for category-based listing.
    Fixed query parameter mismatches (`searchText → search`, `location → city`).
    Implemented Search button functionality to fetch services on click.
    Showed/hid the `<CategoryGrid />` component based on active filter values.
    Embedded Google Maps iframe for the selected service's address in the map sidebar.


 Backend (Node.js / Express / Mongoose):

    Enhanced the Service List API (`/api/services/list`) to support:

    categorySlug → categoryId conversion
    search, city, minorityType filters
    sorting by price, rating, and reviews.
    Developed the Get Service by Slug API to:

    Fetch the service by slug
    Fetch and include related reviews
    
    Ensured category-based filtering works correctly by querying `ServiceCategory` using the slug.
