 Frontend (Next.js / TypeScript):

 Integrated Get Service by Slug API (`/api/public/services/:slug`) on the Service Detail page.
 Displayed service details and reviews dynamically instead of using static data.
 Corrected TypeScript types for `Service` and `Review`, and created an API response interface.
 Handled Loading and Not Found states using Loader2 and AlertTriangle icons.
 Converted phone, email, and website fields into clickable `tel:`, `mailto:`, and external links.
 Connected to the Service List API (`/api/services/list`) for category-based listing.
 Fixed query parameter mismatches (`searchText → search`, `location → city`).
 Implemented Search button functionality to fetch services on click.
 Showed/hid the `<CategoryGrid />` component based on active filter values.
 Embedded Google Maps iframe for the selected service's address in the map sidebar.

 Backend (Node.js / Express / Mongoose):

 Enhanced the Service List API (`/api/services/list`) to support:

   categorySlug → categoryId conversion
   search, city, minorityType filters
   sorting by price, rating, and reviews.
 Developed the Get Service by Slug API to:

   Fetch the service by slug
   Fetch and include related reviews
   
 Ensured category-based filtering works correctly by querying `ServiceCategory` using the slug.
