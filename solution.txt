I enhanced the Navbar by adding gender-based avatars with a dropdown menu for logged-in users, including Dashboard, Profile, and Logout options. I implemented a breathing animation on login buttons to avoid flicker while checking cookies. Additionally, I developed a logout API that clears all cookies, including HttpOnly tokens, and updated middleware to handle role-based redirection and access control. A shared Profile page was maintained for all roles. Lastly, I designed and implemented a fully responsive Business Registration page with labeled fields, validations, and API integration.



developed and styled the complete business registration form with dynamic plan selection, file uploads (logo and cover image), and integrated form submission with loading and feedback handling, structured the routing to redirect users to `/partners` (Business Owner Dashboard) after registration and created the `/partners/[businessid]/setup` page to handle bank details.Developed the bank details UI based on the provided figma Design, fixed a TypeScript warning
